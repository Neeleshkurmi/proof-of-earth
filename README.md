# Proof of Earth

## Project Description
"Proof of Earth" is a blockchain-based system designed to verify and store proof of Earth's presence for individuals, allowing them to submit verifiable proof of their location or engagement in Earth-related activities. The project uses smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for secure and transparent record-keeping.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a global registry of users' Earth-related proof, which could range from environmental contributions, scientific participation, or even location-based verifications. This decentralized system ensures that proof can be verified without relying on centralized authorities, thereby increasing transparency and trust.

## Key Features
- **Proof Submission:** Users can submit proof of their Earth presence with unique proof IDs.
- **Proof Verification:** Allows anyone to verify whether a user has submitted proof.
- **Decentralized & Secure:** All proofs are stored securely on the Ethereum blockchain, making the data immutable and transparent.
- **Public Access:** Users can easily retrieve the proof of other users.

## Future Scope
- **Geospatial Proofs:** Integrating GPS data or location-based services to add another layer of verifiability.
- **Verification via AI:** Using AI to analyze and verify proof submitted by users, especially for non-geospatial proofs.
- **Integrate with Environmental Impact Systems:** Allow users to submit proof of their contributions to environmental sustainability or climate-related activities.
- **Community Governance:** Implementing decentralized governance where the community votes on whether proofs are valid or not.
